- Trains multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Provides comprehensive visualizations and performance metrics
- Supports both 2D (visualizable) and high-dimensional data

### 2. Intelligent Chatbot
- Uses OpenAI's GPT models for natural language processing
- Detects intent (factual vs creative queries)
- Maintains conversation memory
- Works in both API mode and local fallback mode
